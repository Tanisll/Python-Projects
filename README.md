###Phonebook
This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and
email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
###Check Files Gui
This project allows the user to choose transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another.
All files that are moved will be saved in a database.
###Text Based Game
This project was a fun very basic game that allowed the user to input their own commands into the
shell and make decisions which affect the outcome of the game.
###Webpage Generator
This project allows the user to modify the contents of an HTML file to change what the website says.
This is a great example of a basic concept with bigger applications for the end user to modify 
their website whenever they want.
###Checkbook App
This was definitely the largest project during the course. This online portal app comuncates with 
a server to allow a user to create their own account and use it as their own digital checkbook.
The user can make transactions (withdrawals or deposites) and the app will keep a running total
for them.
